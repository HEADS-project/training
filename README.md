HEADS IDE Training and Tutorials
================================

![HEADS](http://heads-project.eu/sites/default/files/heads_large.png)

This repository contains a set of tutorials to get started with the technologies developed in the [HEADS research project](http://heads-project.eu/).

These tutorials are currently used internally in the HEADS project in order to evaluate the initial release of the HEADS IDE. However, these tutorial can be followed by external developers with no prior knoledge of the HEADS technologies. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any enquiry or would like more information.

## List of tutorials

We currently have a list of 5 tutorials (under development). We will update there descriptions when they are available. These tutorials typically assume that you follow them sequentially but ThingML and Kevoree tutorials might be followed independently.

### 1. HEADS ThingML modelling language basics

Learn the basics of ThingML. How to write you first program in a platform independent way and compile it to different platforms ranging from an Arduino microcontroller to a plain Java program. Also learn how to write platform specific components and link to exiting APIs or libraries.
