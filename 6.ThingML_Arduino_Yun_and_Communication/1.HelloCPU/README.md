#Installation

## Installing libraries on the Yùn

- Go to the 1.HelloCPU folder

- Copy the installation files on your Yùn
```
scp -r Yun_installation_files root@ip.of.your.Yun:/root
```

- Connect to your Yun
```
ssh root@ip.of.your.Yun
```

- Change the permission or the installation script
```
chmod +x /root/Yun_installation_files/install.sh
```
- Lunch the installation script
```
cd Yun_installation_files
./install.sh
```

- Reboot your Yun's CPU by pressing on the "Yùn RST" button

Note that if you currently have a sketch on the MCU which use the Serial1 or any Bridge library component, you might want to hold the "32u4 RST" button before pressing "Yùn RST" and release it only a dozain of second after.
Indeed, when the Yun's CPU reboot there is a moment where it ask to press any key to interrupt the boot, and writing on the Serial1 count may interrupt it.


## Installing Arduino Yun Cross Compiler
- Install the cross compiler
```
docker run lyadis/arduino-yun-cross-compiler > ayxc
chmod +x ayxc
alias ayxc="/path/to/ayxc"
```
More documentation about this docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lyadis/arduino-yun-cross-compiler/)

## Run an example
The first example provided only aims at testing the toolchain ThingML compiler > cross compiler > deployment on the Yun's CPU.

- Compile the HelloCPU.thingml file
- Got to the folder generated
```
ayxc make
```
- Upload HelloCPUCfg on your Yun
- Run it
